		<p>La Paz ([laËˆpas]) is a district in Iloilo City, in the Philippine province of Iloilo, on the island of Panay, in the region of Western Visayas. It is the third-largest district by land area, after Jaro and Mandurriao. In the past, it was known as Ilawod, which means "sea/wet land," along with Jaro, which was referred to as Ilaya, meaning "mountain/dry land."</p>

		<p>La Paz is famous as the birthplace of the popular Filipino noodle soup dish, La Paz Batchoy. La Paz Public Market, considered the birthplace of La Paz Batchoy, is a bustling hub where locals and tourists alike can indulge in this culinary delight.</p>

	<p>Teodorico "Ted" Lepura opened his first batchoy shop, Ted's Oldtimer Lapaz Batchoy, at the La Paz Public Market in 1945. Run by Lepura, his wife and their children, the shop sold what they claim to be the original La Paz batchoy which at that time was priced at 20 centsilio per bowl. In the 1930s, as a teenager, Lepura learned the basics of making La Paz batchoy while working for a Chinese merchant, and eventually concocted his own version of the dish.</p>
